## What the story about
Goyo is a 2018 Filipino epic war film starring Paulo Avelino as the titular "Boy General", Gregorio del Pilar, who fought and died at the Battle of Tirad Pass during the Philippine–American War. It was written, directed, edited, and scored by Jerrold Tarog, and is a sequel to the 2015 film Heneral Luna, which chronicled Antonio Luna's life. Additional members of the ensemble cast include Carlo Aquino, Mon Confiado, Epy Quizon, Gwen Zamora, Empress Schuck, Alvin Anson, and Rafa Siguion-Reyna. It was released on September 5, 2018

### Plot 
Following the assassination of General Antonio Luna,[a] Gregorio "Goyo" del Pilar, a young and brash brigadier general, has been tasked by President Emilio Aguinaldo to hunt down Luna's loyalists who have been charged with treason. One such soldier, Major Manuel Bernal, is captured at the house of Mariano Nable José in Dagupan. Bernal is tortured into rejoining the army, but defiantly refuses and insults Goyo, calling him a "dog" for his loyalty to Aguinaldo; Bernal is then executed. Aguinaldo then promotes Goyo to major general of Pangasinan. With a relative decrease in hostilities, Goyo, along with his older brother Julian, his friend Colonel Vicente Enriquez, and photographer Joven Hernando, spends the entire summer in Dagupan attending festivals and courting Remedios, Mariano's daughter.

Meanwhile, Aguinaldo approaches former prime minister Apolinario Mabini and offers him to rejoin the government as chief justice, which he reluctantly accepts (later in the film, the appointment never materialized). When Mabini asks Aguinaldo about Luna's death, he deflects the question. Elsewhere, General José Alejandrino, Luna's former ally spared from the purge, goes to Manila to negotiate with the American Generals Elwell Stephen Otis and Arthur MacArthur Jr. who both refuse to recognize the sovereignty of the First Philippine Republic unless the Filipinos surrender. The negotiations failed and the war intensifies. Unable to launch a counterattack, Aguinaldo orders the army to retreat to the Cordillera Range with Goyo commanding the vanguard. During the long and exhausting march through the mountains, the army is plagued by persistent American attacks, internal tensions from Luna's old unit, as well as hunger and disease. Goyo is further pressured when Aguinaldo's mother and son are captured.

### Production
Plans for a sequel to Jerrold Tarog's Heneral Luna went underway after its critical and commercial success. Tarog envisioned the sequel as being about Gregorio del Pilar, a young General who, like Heneral Luna's titular protagonist Antonio Luna, was among the Filipino historical figures during the Philippine–American War. Accordingly, Paulo Avelino, who played Del Pilar in Luna, came aboard to reprise his role
